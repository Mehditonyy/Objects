    <h1>Objects!</h1>
    <p>
      Objects are terrific at describing things in code. They are similar to an
      array in that it's a collection of values but, unlike an array, it is a
      collection of values that describes one 'thing'.

    <p>Here's a person who likes dogs and laptops represented as an object:</p>
    <code>{"name":"Max","money":0,"dogs":0,"laptops":0}</code>
    <div style="margin-top: 20px">
      <button id="buy-dog-button">Buy a Dog!</button>
      <button id="dog-dies-button">Dog dies..</button>
      <button id="earn-money-button">work to earn Money!</button>
      <button id="buy-laptop-button">Buy a new laptop!</button>
    </div>
    <p id="error"></p>
